# Outcome compared to campaign goals and launch date

## Overview of Project
In this project we compared the outcomes of play campaigns with their goals and launch date.
### Purpose
Firstly, our purpose was to determine the number of successful, failed and canceled Theater campaigns based on the months they were launched. Secondly we wanted to know the number of successful, failed and canceled Theater plays based on the goals they set for their campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on the image ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](path/to/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) of the outcomes based on launch date line chart, we know that the number of successful campaigns is greater than the failed and canceled campaigns all year long. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on the image ![Outcomes_vs_Goals](path/to/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png) of outcomes based on goal line chart, we know that none of the campaigns were canceled. The results are also more clear since it gives a clear % breakdown of successful and failed outcomes.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some challenges encountered happened while editing the y-axis for the outcome compared to goals chart. Multiple trys and a youtube video later, I figured out how to change the numbers in Y-axis to %. Moreover, I had to try the countifs formula a few times to get it right for the different coloumns in Deliverable 2. The Hint video for countifs formula was very helpful.

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
We can conclude that the highest number of successful campaigns happened during the month of MAY. Also, the highest number of campaigns that failed occurred durin MAY. During the year, the highest number of campaigns happen in the month of MAY. Furthermore, we can conclude that the best times to launch campaigns is between the months of April and July. This is the time when the campaign has the greatest chance of being successful. Also, during these months we see that the number of failed campaigns are a consistent number.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
We can conclude that campaigns that had goals greater than 44999 and less than 49999 have the lowest success rate which goes down to 0% and the highest failure rate which eventually goes up to 100%. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
From the dataset the limitation that arises is that we don't know exactly what caused a campaign to be unsuccessful. We only know that the general public decided that it didn't deserve the total goal amount. We don't quite know what exactly caused the pledges to not meet the total goal numbers.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I believe a chart that shows the successful,failed and canceled campaigns incorporating goal, pledged and outcomes will be very benificial. Also looking at these numbers for each particular country will be very helpful. From such a chart, someone who is planning to do a campaign for a new Theatre play knows the type of play to do which will receive the highest funding in the country. Also it will give a better breakdown of what type of plays to absolutely avoid.
